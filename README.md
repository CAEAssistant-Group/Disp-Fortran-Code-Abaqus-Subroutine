# Disp-Fortran-Code-Abaqus-Subroutine
In this project, we have provided Abaqus input files along with the DISP Abaqus Fortran subroutine, developed to apply complex boundary conditions.

The DISP Fortran Abaqus subroutine in is a user-defined subroutine that allows you to prescribe nodal boundary conditions, such as displacements and temperatures, in a customized manner. It is used in cases where predefined boundary conditions (like fixed supports or enforced displacements or temperatures) are not sufficient, and you need to implement a more complex, time-dependent, or function-based displacement or thermal field.

In the provided files, we have solved a problem in Abaqus using the DISP subroutine. Both the .inp and Fortran files are attached for your use. You can also check our YouTube channel (CAE Assistant) for a more detailed video on the code. By watching this video, we will guide you through writing your first Abaqus DISP subroutine. The problem is illustrated in the following figure.

Moreover, we offer a complete package that thoroughly reviews and introduces all the parameters of the DISP and VDISP subroutines. Multiple workshops are included to guide you step-by-step in writing the code for different problems. You can access the full package via the link in the "About" section on the right side of the repository.
